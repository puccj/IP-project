# IP-project

I made the application portable. I think you can run the application from a windows pc by just lauching Thresholding.exe (trust it, of course)

There are still some problem with the method 3 (Bersen), which is super slow. And the method 0 of padding (all zeros) still make the program crash (line 103-118 of main.cpp, if you want to understand why)
